# Project-Anthony-Randall-Cristian

For project 2, we propose creating a website application for a bar we call “ZVR Pub”. This pub will support web ordering for different 
menu items, including alcohol, build-your-own-burgers, chicken wings, and other menu items. As the tavern sells alcohol, there will be 
server-side validation regarding age of the person ordering food. We will also implement an age restriction for creation of a user account. 
The website will also contain manager functions accessible only by specific users. It will also contain information regarding inventory, 
denying people the ability to order if inventory is too low. It will implement ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Angular, and potentially 
Azure Key Vault. The team will also be following an Agile development strategy utilizing Kanban.
